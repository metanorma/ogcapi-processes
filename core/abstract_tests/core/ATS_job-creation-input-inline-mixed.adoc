. Get a description of each process offered by the server using t
est <<ats_core_process,/conf/core/process>>.
. Inspect the description of each process and identify the subset of processes that have inputs of mixed content using the `oneOf[]` JSON Schema construct to define several alternate input value schemas.
. For each identified process construct an execute request according to test <<ats_core_job-creation-request,/conf/core/job-creation-request>> taking care to encode the identified mix-content inputs in-line in the execute request according to requirement <<req_core_job-creation-input-inline-mixed,/req/core/job-creation-input-inline-mixed>>.
. Verify that each process executes successfully according to the <<ats-job-creation-success-sync,relevant requirement based on the combination of execute parameters.>>
