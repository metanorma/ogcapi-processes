. Get a description of each process offered by the server using test <<ats_core_process,/conf/core/process>>.
. Inspect the description of each process and identify the list of processes that have inputs with a maximum cardinality greater that one.
. For each identified process construct an execute request according to test <<ats_core_job-creation-request,/conf/core/job-creation-request>> taking care to encode the inputs with maximum cardinality > 1 according to the requirement <<req_core_job-creation-input-array,/req/core/job-creation-input-array>>.
. Verify that each process executes successfully according to the <<ats-job-creation-success-sync,relevant requirement based on the combination of execute parameters.>>
