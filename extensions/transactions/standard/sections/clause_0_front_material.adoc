== Abstract

OGC API standards define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web APIs in a consistent way. The <<OpenAPI,OpenAPI specification>> is used to define the API building blocks.

OGC API Processes provides API building blocks to describe, execute, monitor
and retrieve results of Web-accessible processes.  OGC API Processes is
comprised of multiple parts, each of them is a separate standard.

This part extends the core capabilities specified in <<OAProc-1>> with the ability to dynamically add, modify and/or delete individual processes from a deployed processes API.

CAUTION: This is a DRAFT version of the 2nd part of the OGC API - Processes standards. This draft is not complete and there are open issues that are still under discussion.
