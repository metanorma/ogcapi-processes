[.component,class=test-purpose]
Validate that the server responds as expected when getting results from a job for a process that has been executed synchronously.

[.component,class=conditions]
<<req_core_job-results-sync,/req/core/job-results-sync>>

[.component,class=test-method]
-----
. Get a description of each process offered by the server using test <<ats_core_process,/conf/core/process>>.
. Inspect the description of each process and identify the subset of processes that support the `sync-execute` job control option.
. For each identified process construct an execute request according to test <<ats_core_job-creation-request,/conf/core/job-creation-request>> ensuring that synchronous execution is <<sc_execution_mode,negotiated>> according to test <<ats_core_job-creation-default-execution-mode,/conf/core/job-creation-default-execution-mode>>.
. Inspect the headers of the response and see if a `Link` header is included with `rel=monitor`.
. If the link exists, get the job status as per test <<ats_core_job-op,/conf/core/job-op>> and ensure that the job status is set to `successful`.
