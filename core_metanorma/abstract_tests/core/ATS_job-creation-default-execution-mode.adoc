^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/core/job-creation-default-execution-mode*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that the server correctly handles the default execution mode for a process.
^|Requirement |<<req_core_job-creation-op,/req/core/job-creation-op>>
^|Test Method |. Get a description of each process offered by the server using test <<ats_core_process,/conf/core/process>>.
. Inspect the description of each process and take note of the job control options for the process.
. Without setting the HTTP `Prefer` header, construct an execute request according to test <<ats_core_job-creation-request,/conf/core/job-creation-request>>.
. For processes that are supposed to execute asynchronously according to the <<req_core_job-creation-default-execution-mode,/req/core/job-creation-default-execution-mode>> requirement, verify the successful execution according to the <<ats_core_job-creation-success-async,/conf/core/job-creation-success-async>> test.
. For processes that are supposed to execute synchronously according to the <<req_core_job-creation-auto-execution-mode,/req/core/job-creation-auto-execution-mode>> requirement, verify the successful synchronous execution according to the <<ats-job-creation-success-sync,relevant requirement based on the combination of execute parameters.>>
