Validate that inputs with a bounding box schema encoded in-line in an execute request are correctly processed.

[.component,class=test-method]

. Get a description of each process offered by the server using test <<ats_core_process,/conf/core/process>>.
. Inspect the description of each process and identify the subset of processes that have bounding box inputs that are supposed to conform to the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-processes/master/core/openapi/schemas/bbox.yaml[bbox.yaml] schema.
. For each identified process construct an execute request according to test <<ats_core_job-creation-request,/conf/core/job-creation-request>> taking care to encode values for the identified bounding box inputs in-line in the execute request.
. Verify that each process executes successfully according to the <<ats_job-creation-success,relevant requirement based on the combination of execute parameters>>.
