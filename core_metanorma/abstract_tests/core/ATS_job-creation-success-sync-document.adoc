[.component,class=test-purpose]
Validate that the server responds as expected when synchronous execution is <<sc_execution_code,negotiated>> and the response type is `document`.

-----
. Get a description of each process offered by the server using test <<ats_core_process,/conf/core/process>>.
. Inspect the description of each process and identify the subset of processes that support the `sync-execute` job control option.
. For each identified process construct an execute request according to test <<ats_core_job-creation-request,/conf/core/job-creation-request>> ensuring that synchronous execution has been <<sc_execution_mode,negotiated>> according to tests <<ats_core_job-creation-default-execution-mode,/conf/core/job-creation-default-execution-mode>> and the requested response type is `document` (i.e. `"response": "document"`) according to requirement <<req_core_job-creation-sync-document,/req /core/job-creation-sync-document>>.
. Verify that each process executes successfully according to requirement <<req_core_job-creation-sync-document,/req/core/job-creation-sync-document>>.
