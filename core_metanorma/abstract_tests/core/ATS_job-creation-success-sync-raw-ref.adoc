^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/core/job-creation-sync-raw-ref*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that the server responds as expected when synchronous execution is <<sc_execution_mode,negotiated>>, the response type is `raw` and the transmission mode is `ref`.
^|Requirement |<<req_core_job-creation-sync-raw-ref,/req/core/job-creation-sync-raw-ref>>
^|Test Method |. Get a description of each process offered by the server using test <<ats_core_process,/conf/core/process>>.
. Inspect the description of each process and identify the subset of processes that support the `sync-execute` job control option and the `reference` output transmission.
. For each identified process construct an execute request according to test <<ats_core_job-creation-request,/conf/core/job-creation-request>> ensuring that synchronous execution is <<sc_execution_mode,negotiated>> according to test <<ats_core_job-creation-default-execution-mode,/conf/core/job-creation-default-execution-mode>>, that the requested response type is `raw` (i.e. `"response": "raw"`) and the transmission mode is set to `ref` (i.e. `"transmissionMode": "ref"`) according to requirement <<req_core_job-creation-sync-raw-ref,/req/core/job-creation-sync-raw-ref>>.
. Verify that each process executes successfully according to requirement <<req_core_job-creation-sync-raw-ref,/req/core/job-creation-sync-raw-ref>>.
