^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/core/job-creation-input-inline-binary* +
^|Test Purpose |Validate that binary input values encoded as base-64 string in-line in an execute request are correctly processes.
^|Requirement |<<req_core_job-creations-input-binary,/req/core/job-creation-input-binary>>
^|Test Method |. Get a description of each process offered by the server using t
est <<ats_core_process,/conf/core/process>>.
. Inspect the description of each process and identify the subset of processes that have binary inputs.
. For each identified process construct an execute request according to test <<ats_core_job-creation-request,/conf/core/job-creation-request>> taking care to encode binary input values in-line in the execute request according to requirement <<req_core_job-creation-input-inline-binary,/req/core/job-creation-input-inline-binary>>.
. Verify that each process executes successfully according to the <<ats-job-creation-success-sync,relevant requirement based on the combination of execute parameters.>>
