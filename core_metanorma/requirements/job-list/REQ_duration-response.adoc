^|Condition |. If the `status` parameter is not specified then only jobs that are running (status: `running`) or have completed execution (`successful`, `failed` or `dismissed`) SHALL be considered for inclusion in the response.
. If the `status` parameter is specified, then only jobs with the speecified status SHALL be considered for inclusion in the response.
^|A |If only the `minDuration` parameter is specified with the operation, only jobs with the appropriate status and a duration of at least the specified `minDuration` value SHALL be included in the response.
^|B |If only the `maxDuration` parameter is specified with the operation, only jobs with the appropriate status and a duration of no longer than the specified `maxDuration` value SHALL be included in the response.
^|C |If both the `minDuration` and `maxDuration` parameters are specified with the operation, only jobs with the appropriate status and a duration of at least the specified `minDuration` value and no longer than the specified `maxDuration` value SHALL be included in the response.
^|D |The value of the `minDuration` and `maxDuration` parameters SHALL be number of seconds.
^|E |For running jobs, the duration SHALL be computed at runtime as the time the operation was invoked minus the value of the `started` parameter  (see: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-processes/master/core/openapi/schemas/statusInfo.yaml[statusInfo.yaml]).
^|F |For completed jobs, the duration SHALL be computed as the value of the `finished` parameter minus the value of the `started` parameter  (see: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-processes/master/core/openapi/schemas/statusInfo.yaml[statusInfo.yaml]).
^|G |Jobs for which runtime statistics are not included in the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-processes/master/core/openapi/schemas/statusInfo.yaml[status information] or are incomplete for computing the duration of the job SHALL be omitted from the response.
